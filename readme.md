To stay sharp, I find it helpful to regularly practice data structures and algorithms. This repository is a place to keep track of solutions by patterns. Of course some problems can be solved with different patterns, so the organization is at best an approximation.

In general, I find some "perfect" leetcode solutions to be unreadable or impractical. My goal here is to practice the thinking while also always trying to write stylistically acceptable code. As I progress, no doubt my opinions on style may change.
